# Village Bridge
Toggles the 16 possible versions of the [Village Bridge theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpCYukHV6s) from Pokémon Black and White/Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. Hopefully relaxing.

Audacity was used to record and edit each theme. GIMP was used to isolate and animate the NPC sprites. Google searches to W3Schools were used for significant HTML and JavaScript guidance.

Downloading is recommended since the site struggles to run it properly.
